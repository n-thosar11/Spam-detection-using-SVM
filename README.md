# Spam-detection-using-SVM

We will use Support Vector machine algorithm using scikit-learn library in python programming language to train and classify the input text message as a spam or not.

For the model to work we first need to convert the text to numerical data, so that model can classify messages easily.  For that we will use vectorization.
The problem with a bag of words is that it assigns the same importance value(Weights) to all the words. This is resolved when we TF-IDF as it assigns different weights to the words.
